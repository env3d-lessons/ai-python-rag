# Non-LLM Pre-trained Models 

Huggingface has python libraries to interact with models on their websites.

There are lots of models that are not LLMs that we can access.

# Sentence-transformers

Let's explore the sentence-transformers library: https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers

First we need to install it

```bash
$ pip install sentence-transformers
$ pip install faiss-cpu
```

Then write the following python code:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

```
